# Bits UI Code of Conduct

We want Bits UI to be a welcoming and productive community for everyone. To that end, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to others in all interactions.

**In short: Don't be an asshole.**

More specifically:

- **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with respect, even if you disagree. Personal attacks, harassment, and aggressive behavior are not acceptable.
- **Be Constructive:** Focus on constructive feedback and discussions. Avoid unproductive negativity or complaining without offering solutions.
- **Focus on Contributions**: We welcome contributions based on their merit and value to the project. All contributors will be treated fairly and respectfully, and discriminatory behavior is not allowed.

**Unacceptable behavior includes (but is not limited to):**

- Personal attacks, insults, or threats.
- Harassment, bullying, or intimidation.
- Discrimination based on any personal attribute.
- Spamming, trolling, or deliberately disruptive behavior.
- Sharing private information without consent.

**Enforcement:**

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. In serious cases, participants may be temporarily or permanently banned from the project.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub (issues, discussions, pull requests), Discord chat channels, and any other official communication platforms.
