## TODOs

These are outstanding tasks that need to be completed or addressed before the project is ready for release.

- [x] Make the component which receives the `name` prop consistent across the `DateField` and `DateRangeField`, `DatePicker` and `DateRangePicker` components.
- [ ] Determine how to handle validation for the various date and time components. Ideally in a way that those using libraries like `sveltekit-superforms` and those that aren't can both benefit from.
- [ ] Determine the ideal approach for managing the `data-<component>` attributes.
- [ ] Expose the various `open` states via snippet props for all compoents with the `forceMount` prop for controlled transitions and animations. Thinking more about this, we don't need to pass it via `children`, only via the `child` snippet.
- [ ] Handle the `invalid` state for the `DateRangeField` component.
- [ ] Determine how we can give users the ability to opt-out of Floating UI styles.
- [ ] Now that `Select` is more similar to a native `<select>` element, we need to come up with a solution/component for `MultiSelect` or just `Select` without the underlying `<select>` element and behavior. I want to have a separate `Listbox` component that doesn't have to be within a "popover-like" component and can just be static on the page, so Listbox isn't a fitting component name.
- [ ] Select deselection of items
