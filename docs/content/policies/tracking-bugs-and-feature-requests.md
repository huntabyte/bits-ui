title: Tracking Bugs and Feature Requests
description: How we use Issues and Discussions to track bugs and manage feature requests efficiently.
---

This document explains how we use GitHub Issues and Discussions in this repository. Each serves a distinct purpose to keep our development process organized and efficient. Please read this before opening a new issue or discussion!

TL;DR:

-   **Issues**: For confirmed bugs and tracking accepted feature requests that are ready for implementation.
-   **Discussions**: For proposing new features, asking questions, and discussing broader changes _before_ any code is written.

## Issues: For Bugs and Accepted Feature Requests

We use GitHub Issues for:

-   **Reproducible Bugs**: Clearly describe steps to reproduce the problem. Include error messages, screenshots, and expected vs. actual behavior. Vague reports will likely be closed.
-   **Confirmed Problems**: Issues should relate to existing functionality in the project, not requests for new features.
-   **Accepted Feature Requests**: Only feature requests that have been discussed, refined, and approved for implementation will have an issue created to track progress.

### Why This Approach?

-   **Keeps the Issue Tracker Focused**: By only adding feature requests that are actually planned for implementation, we avoid clutter.
-   **Clear Prioritization**: Maintainers and contributors can focus on resolving real bugs and implementing agreed-upon features.
-   **Better Project Health**: The backlog remains clean, making it easier to track progress and manage the project effectively.

## Discussions: Where Feature Requests Start

Feature requests should always start as a **Discussion**. This ensures that ideas are vetted and refined before committing to implementation.

Use Discussions for:

-   **Feature Requests**: Propose and refine new features.
-   **Design Discussion**: Before writing code, ensure the implementation is well thought out.
-   **Questions and Support**: Get help from the community.
-   **Brainstorming**: Share ideas and explore alternatives.
-   **RFCs (Request for Comments)**: Gather structured feedback before making significant changes.

### When Does a Feature Request Become an Issue?

Feature requests start as discussions to ensure they are well-defined, useful, and feasible. Only accepted requests ready for implementation become issues.

Here's what the process typically looks like for a feature request to move from a discussion to an issue:

1. **Start a Discussion** – Describe your feature, its benefits, and any potential challenges.
2. **Gather Feedback** – Engage with the community and refine the idea based on input.
3. **Refine and Finalize** – If the feature gains consensus and is deemed valuable, a maintainer will determine if it should move forward.
4. **Issue Creation** – Once accepted for implementation, a maintainer or contributor will create an issue to track its progress.

### What If a Feature Request is Opened as an Issue?

If an issue is opened requesting a new feature, a maintainer will:

1. **Convert it to a Discussion** (if not yet accepted).
2. **Explain the Move** with a comment linking to this policy.
3. **Close the Original Issue** to keep the tracker clean.

This isn't to reject your idea - it's about ensuring every feature request is thoughtfully considered before moving into development.

## Summary

-   **Discussions are for feature requests** until they are accepted and planned for implementation.
-   **Issues are for confirmed bugs** and tracking accepted feature requests in development.

This keeps our backlog focused, helps us prioritize effectively, and leads to a more efficient and organized development process. Thanks for helping us keep things structured and effective!
