title: Code of Conduct
description: Our expectations for community behavior
---

We want Bits UI to be a welcoming and productive community for everyone. To that end, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy in all interactions.

**In short: Treat others with respect and contribute positively.**

## Community Guidelines

-   **Be Respectful** – Treat everyone with respect, even when you disagree. Personal attacks, harassment, and aggressive behavior are not tolerated.
-   **Be Constructive** – Focus on productive discussions and feedback. Avoid negativity without offering solutions.
-   **Follow Contribution Guidelines** – Feature requests should start as discussions before being considered for implementation. Issues should be limited to confirmed bugs or accepted feature requests ready for development.
-   **Keep Discussions On-Topic** – Use the appropriate channels for discussions, issues, and pull requests to keep the project organized and efficient.

## Unacceptable Behavior Includes (but is not limited to):

-   Personal attacks, insults, or threats.
-   Harassment, bullying, or intimidation.
-   Discrimination based on any personal attribute.
-   Spamming, trolling, or deliberately disruptive behavior.
-   Sharing private information without consent.

## Enforcement

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. In serious cases, participants may be temporarily or permanently banned from the project.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub (issues, discussions, pull requests), Discord chat channels, and any other official communication platforms.
