description: A type helper to exclude the child snippet prop from a component.
---

The `WithoutChild` type helper is used to exclude the `child` snippet prop from a component. This is useful when you're building custom component wrappers that populate the `children` prop of a component and don't provide a way to pass a custom `child` snippet.

To learn more about the `child` snippet prop, check out the [delegation](/docs/child-snippet) documentation.

```svelte title="CustomAccordionHeader.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { Accordion, type WithoutChild } from "bits-ui";

  let { children, ...restProps }: WithoutChild<Accordion.ItemProps> = $props();
</script>

<Accordion.Header {...restProps}>
  <Accordion.Trigger>
    {@render children?.()}
  </Accordion.Trigger>
</Accordion.Header>
```
