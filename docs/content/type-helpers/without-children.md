description: A type helper to exclude the children snippet prop from a component.
---

The `WithoutChildren` type helper is used to exclude the `children` snippet prop from a component. This is useful when you're building custom component wrappers that populate the `children` prop of a component.

```svelte title="CustomAccordion.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { Accordion, type WithoutChildren } from "bits-ui";

  let {
    value,
    onValueChange,
    ...restProps
  }: WithoutChildren<Accordion.RootProps> = $props();
</script>

<Accordion.Root {...restProps}>
  <Accordion.Item {value} {onValueChange}>
    <Accordion.Header />
    <Accordion.Trigger />
    <Accordion.Content />
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

In the example above, we're using the `WithoutChildren` type helper to exclude the `children` snippet prop from the `Accordion.Root` component. This ensures our exposed props are consistent with what is being used internally.
